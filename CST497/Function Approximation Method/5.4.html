    <github-md>Okay, here's course text on "Linear Methods" for a Reinforcement Learning course, drawing from the provided materials and expanding upon them for clarity:

**9.3 Linear Methods**

In the realm of reinforcement learning, simpler function approximation methods, particularly linear methods, are fundamental to many learning systems.  These methods offer a balance between computational efficiency and expressiveness.

**Why Linear Methods?**

*   **Foundation:** Linear methods serve as a bedrock for understanding more complex function approximation techniques. They provide a clear starting point for analyzing learning dynamics.
*   **Theoretical Guarantees:**  The gradient-descent TD(λ) algorithm, when used with a linear function approximator, has proven convergence properties. Specifically, if the step-size parameter is reduced over time according to standard conditions, the algorithm converges to a parameter vector, *w∞*. (Note: this is not necessarily the optimal parameter vector, *w*<sup>*</sup>). However, the error of this parameter vector (*w∞*) is bounded by a factor of  (1 - γλ) / (1 - γ) multiplied by the smallest possible error (RMSE(*w*<sup>*</sup>)). 
    *   **Impact of λ:** As λ approaches 1, the bound on the asymptotic error approaches the minimum possible error. This means that when λ is closer to 1 (more emphasis on longer-term rewards), the learned value function is more accurate.
    *   **On-Policy Convergence:**  Similar convergence guarantees hold for other on-policy bootstrapping methods. For example, linear gradient-descent DP backups, using the on-policy distribution, converge to the same result as TD(0). These results technically apply to discounted continuing tasks, but a related result is believed to hold for episodic tasks.
    *   **Important Note:**  These convergence results rely on the crucial condition that states are backed up according to the on-policy distribution. If a different backup distribution is used, bootstrapping methods with function approximation might diverge.
*   **Practical Efficiency:** Linear methods can be very efficient in practice, in terms of both data usage and computation, making them a good first choice for many problems.

**Representation and Features**

The effectiveness of linear methods depends critically on how states are represented using features. Choosing appropriate features is a way to add prior knowledge into the system. Features should be chosen to correspond to the natural characteristics of the task, where generalization is most appropriate.

*   **Examples:**
    *   For valuing geometric objects, features might include shape, color, size, or function.
    *   For a mobile robot, features might describe locations, battery power, and sensor readings.
*   **Feature Combinations:** It is often necessary to also use features that represent combinations of natural qualities. This is because the linear form cannot represent interactions between features (such as feature *i* being good only when feature *j* is absent).
    *   **Example:** In pole balancing, a high angular velocity can be good or bad depending on the angular position. If the angle is high, high angular velocity means an imminent fall, while if the angle is low, it can be beneficial. This means we need features that capture the interplay of position and velocity.

**Limitations of Linear Methods**

*   **Limited Expressiveness:** Linear methods cannot capture complex, non-linear relationships between features. 
*   **Feature Engineering:**  The need for careful feature engineering is a potential drawback. The performance of a linear method depends heavily on the features that are chosen.

**Summary**

Linear methods are a fundamental class of function approximation techniques in reinforcement learning. They are characterized by their simplicity, theoretical guarantees, and practical efficiency. While they have limitations, particularly in capturing complex interactions between features, they serve as a crucial starting point for understanding more advanced methods and are often effective in their own right.

**Explanation of Content Choices**

*   **Directly from Text:** I have included all the core concepts about linear methods as presented in the provided text, such as the convergence properties of TD(λ) with linear function approximation, the importance of the on-policy distribution, the dependence on features, and the examples of features for different tasks.
*   **Clarity and Organization:** The text is organized into sections with headings for better readability.  I've added bullet points to make the key ideas and specific points more accessible.
*   **Explanation:** I've expanded on the core ideas to make them easier to understand. For example, I explain *why* linear methods are useful, and I clarify what is meant by the convergence result.
*   **Emphasis on Key Concepts:** I've emphasized the importance of feature selection and the limitations of linear methods.
*   **Omitted Information:** I have removed all information that is not directly related to the content of the topic, such as the date, author, and college information.  I've also removed the figure references, and specific algorithm numbers as they were not central to understanding the main ideas.

This text is intended to serve as a concise and informative introduction to linear methods in the context of a reinforcement learning course, suitable for students who are learning this material.
