    <github-md>Okay, here's a course text section on "Optimal Policies and Optimal Value Functions" for a Reinforcement Learning course, drawing from the provided material and expanding for clarity:

**Optimal Policies and Optimal Value Functions**

In reinforcement learning, our goal is to find a policy that maximizes the expected cumulative reward. This leads us to the concepts of optimal policies and optimal value functions.

**Partial Ordering of Policies**

We can establish a way to compare policies using a partial ordering. A policy π is considered to be better than or equal to another policy π' (denoted as π ≥ π') if the value of every state under policy π is greater than or equal to the value of that state under policy π':

   *  π ≥ π' if  *v*<sup>π</sup>(*s*) ≥ *v*<sup>π'</sup>(*s*) for all states *s*.

This means that, for every state, you can expect at least as much reward by following policy π as you would by following policy π'.

**Existence of an Optimal Policy**

A crucial theorem in reinforcement learning guarantees that for any Markov Decision Process (MDP), there exists at least one optimal policy, denoted as π*. This optimal policy is better than or equal to *all* other policies:

   *  There exists an optimal policy π* such that π* ≥ π, for all policies π.

This theorem is fundamental because it assures us that we are not searching for an unattainable goal. There *is* a best way to behave in an MDP.

**Optimal Value Functions**

All optimal policies achieve the same optimal value function, denoted as *v*<sup>\*</sup>(*s*). This optimal value function represents the maximum expected cumulative reward that can be obtained starting from state *s*:

   *  *v*<sup>π\*</sup>(*s*) = *v*<sup>\*</sup>(*s*)

Similarly, all optimal policies achieve the same optimal action-value function, denoted as *q*<sup>\*</sup>(*s*, *a*). This represents the maximum expected cumulative reward that can be obtained starting from state *s* and taking action *a*:

   * *q*<sup>π\*</sup>(*s*,*a*) = *q*<sup>\*</sup>(*s*,*a*)

**Policy Improvement**

One way to find an optimal policy is through policy iteration. The core idea is to iteratively improve a policy until it becomes optimal. This is done by acting greedily with respect to the current policy’s value function, which is called policy improvement.

 Given a current policy, π, we can improve it by choosing the action that maximizes the action-value function *q*<sup>π</sup>(*s*,*a*) for each state *s*:

   *  π'(*s*) = argmax<sub>*a*∈*A*</sub> *q*<sup>π</sup>(*s*, *a*)

This means that, for each state *s*, the new policy π' chooses the action that, according to the current value function, will lead to the highest expected cumulative reward.

**Why Policy Improvement Works**

The key to policy improvement is that this new policy π' will always be at least as good as the current policy π. Specifically, it will improve the value from any state *s* over one step:

   *   *q*<sup>π</sup>(*s*, π'(*s*)) = max<sub>*a*∈*A*</sub> *q*<sup>π</sup>(*s*, *a*) ≥ *q*<sup>π</sup>(*s*, π(*s*)) = *v*<sup>π</sup>(*s*)

This improvement in one step propagates to an overall improvement in the value function:

   * *v*<sup>π'</sup>(*s*) ≥ *v*<sup>π</sup>(*s*)

The process continues by using the improved policy π' to calculate a new value function, and then improving that policy to π'', and so on, until an optimal policy is reached.
