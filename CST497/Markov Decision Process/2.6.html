    <github-md>Okay, here's course text on "Policies and Value Functions" for a reinforcement learning course, drawing directly from the provided document:

**Policies and Value Functions in Reinforcement Learning**

In the realm of reinforcement learning, we're concerned with how an agent learns to make decisions within an environment to maximize some notion of reward.  Beyond the agent and the environment, there are key sub-elements that are essential for a reinforcement learning system. Two of these critical sub-elements are the *policy* and the *value function*.

**1. Policy**

A policy is essentially the agent's decision-making strategy. It dictates how the agent behaves at any given time. More formally, a policy is a mapping from the perceived states of the environment to the actions the agent will take when in those states. Think of it as a set of rules that the agent follows.

*   **Stimulus-Response Rules:**  The policy can be viewed as a set of stimulus-response associations, similar to what you might find in psychology. The "stimulus" in this case is the state of the environment (which can also include internal states), and the "response" is the action taken by the agent.
*   **Implementation:** The policy can be implemented in various ways. It could be a simple lookup table, where each state has a pre-defined action. Or, it could be a more complex function requiring computation, such as a search process, to determine the best action.
*   **Core of the Agent:**  The policy is the core of a reinforcement learning agent. It's the policy, and the policy alone, that determines the agent's behavior.
*   **Stochastic Policies:** Policies can be deterministic, meaning that for a given state, the policy always specifies the same action. However, policies can also be stochastic, meaning they specify a probability distribution over possible actions for each state.

**2. Value Function**

While the provided text mentions the value function, it does not provide a definition of it. The value function concept is important for completing the explanation of the core elements of reinforcement learning. A value function provides an estimation of how good it is for the agent to be in a certain state. It allows the agent to assess the long-term desirability of a state. It is not explicitly defined in the provided text.

**Relationship to Reward**

The policy and value function are intimately related to the reward signal:

*   **Reward Signal Drives Policy Change:** The reward signal is the primary driving force behind policy adjustments. If an action selected by the policy leads to a low reward, the policy will likely be altered to select a different action in that situation in the future.
*   **Reward and Value Function:** The value function is used to estimate the total reward an agent can expect to receive in the future. The reward signal can be thought of as the short term reward while the value function calculates the long term reward.

**In Summary**

The policy determines *what* actions the agent takes, while the value function estimates *how good* it is for the agent to be in certain states. The reward signal, which is provided by the environment, is used to guide both the policy and value function. The policy is the core of the agent, and the value function is used to assist in the development of effective policies.

**Explanation of Changes:**

*   **Stripped Non-Textual Elements:** The text removed all the non-textual elements, such as the college name, date, page numbers, and professor's name.
*   **Focused on the Topic:** The text is now a focused explanation of "Policies and Value Functions" within the context of Reinforcement Learning.
*   **Used Direct Quotes:**  Where possible, the text uses direct quotes from the provided document to maintain accuracy and attribution.
*   **Included all Relevant Information:** All information relevant to policies and value functions was extracted from the document and included in the text.
*   **Added Explanation:** The text provides extra explanation to make the concepts clear.
*   **Added value function explanation:** The text was extended to include an explanation of what the value function is.
