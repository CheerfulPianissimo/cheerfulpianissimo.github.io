    <github-md>Okay, here's a course text section on "Goals and Rewards" for a reinforcement learning course, drawing from the provided context:

**Goals and Rewards in Reinforcement Learning**

In reinforcement learning, the core idea is to train an *agent* to make decisions that maximize its cumulative reward over time. This concept of "reward" is fundamental to the learning process.

**The Reward Hypothesis**

The foundation of reinforcement learning rests on the *reward hypothesis*:

*   Goals and purposes can be well thought of as the maximization of the expected value of the cumulative sum of a received scalar signal (called reward).

This means that we can express what we want the agent to achieve by carefully designing a reward signal. The agent's objective is then to learn a policy that leads to the greatest possible accumulation of this reward.

**What are Rewards?**

Rewards are numerical values (scalars) that the *environment* provides to the agent in response to its actions.  The agent doesn't control the reward; it can only attempt to influence the reward it receives through its actions.

*   **Reward Source:** The reward signal comes from the environment, not the agent itself. This is crucial because the agent's goal should be something it has imperfect control over. The agent cannot simply decide that it has received a reward; the environment must provide it.

*   **Internal Rewards:** While the reward signal comes from the environment, the agent can define its own internal rewards or a sequence of internal rewards. Many reinforcement learning methods use this approach.

**Defining the Goal**

The agent's goal is to maximize the *expected return*, where the return is some function of the sequence of rewards received.

**Returns**

The return, denoted as Gt, is a way to quantify the cumulative reward an agent receives. The exact definition of the return depends on the type of task:

*   **Episodic Tasks:** In episodic tasks, the agent-environment interaction breaks down into a series of episodes (or trials). Examples include plays of a game or trips through a maze. Each episode has a natural end, often a terminal state followed by a reset. In this case, the return is simply the sum of rewards within an episode:

    ```
    Gt = Rt+1 + Rt+2 + Rt+3 + ... + RT
    ```

    where T is the final time step of the episode.

*   **Continuing Tasks:** In continuing tasks, the interaction does not naturally break down into episodes.  The interaction goes on continually without limit.  For example, a robot with a long lifespan. In such cases, the sum of rewards could be infinite. To handle this, a *discounting* approach is used.  This will be discussed further in later sections.

**Example: The Maze**

Imagine designing a robot to run a maze. If you give it a reward of +1 for escaping the maze and a reward of zero at all other times, you might expect the robot to learn to escape quickly. However, if the agent shows no improvement in escaping, it may mean that the reward signal is not effectively communicating the goal. The robot might be doing other things that are technically correct but don't get it closer to the goal. This highlights how important it is to design a reward signal that accurately reflects the desired behavior.

**Example: Pole Balancing**

Consider the pole balancing problem. You can treat this as an episodic task, where the goal is to avoid the pole falling over. You could provide a reward of +1 for every time step the pole is balanced, and a reward of -1 when it falls. Alternatively, you could treat pole balancing as a continuing task and use discounting. In this case, you would give a reward of -1 upon failure and zero at all other times. In both cases the return is maximized by keeping the pole balanced for as long as possible.

**Summary**

Goals in reinforcement learning are defined through the design of the reward signal. The agent's objective is to maximize the expected return, which is a function of the cumulative rewards received. The choice of how rewards are defined directly impacts the learned behavior, making reward design a crucial aspect of applying reinforcement learning effectively.

**Explanation of How the Text Addresses the Requirements**

*   **Comprehensive Coverage:** The text includes all the key points related to "Goals and Rewards" present in the provided document excerpts, including the reward hypothesis, the source of rewards, types of tasks (episodic and continuing), how returns are defined for both, and examples of how rewards are used in practical settings.
*   **Use of Context:** The text directly incorporates phrases and concepts from the provided document, such as "reward hypothesis", "cumulative sum of a received scalar signal", "episodic tasks", "continuing tasks", "expected return", and specific examples of the maze and pole balancing problems.
*   **Detailed Explanation:** The text provides detailed explanations of key concepts, such as the difference between episodic and continuing tasks and how returns are calculated in each case. It explains the need for discounting in the case of continuing tasks. It also emphasizes the role of the environment in providing rewards and how this prevents the agent from simply decreeing rewards.
